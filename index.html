		<p><img class="res_img_right" src="images/me2.jpg">Welcome! I am an assistant professor in the
			<a href="https://physics.asu.edu" title="ASU Physics website">Department of Physics</a> at
			<a href="https://www.asu.edu" title="ASU website">Arizona State University</a>,
			where I work on
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology" title="Wikipedia page on cosmology">cosmology</a>:
			the study of the evolution and contents of the universe as a whole.
			My research encompasses theory, simulations, and data analysis, with the common
			theme of developing methods for learning more about the universe.
		</p>

		<p>My recent activities primarily focus on
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensity_mapping" title="Wikipedia: Intensity mapping">21cm intensity mapping</a>,
			a (relatively) new way to probe the cosmic distribution
			of matter by measuring radiation from distant clouds of neutral hydrogen, and use it to learn
			about the fundamental laws of nature and our universe.
			I am a member of the <a href="http://chime-experiment.ca/" title="CHIME website">CHIME</a> collaboration,
			which is currently analyzing data from a custom-built radio telescope designed for this technique, and
			the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01777" title="CHORD white paper">CHORD collaboration</a>,
			which is building a successor telescope to CHIME.
			I was also involved in the <a href="http://www.puma.bnl.gov/" title="PUMA website">PUMA</a> group
			when it was active,
			hepling to develop a concept for a next-generation telescope that would use 21cm intensity mapping to obtain
			transformative cosmological constraints.
		</p>

		<p>Beyond this, I have broad interests in cosmology, and have worked on
			perturbation theory for large-scale structure,
			baryonic effects on large-scale clustering,
			non-21cm line intensity mapping, and
			several other topics.
		</p>
