			<h2>Overview</h2>
		<!-- </br> -->
				<p>I am broadly interested in developing and refining methods we can use to learn about the universe. This encompasses theoretical predictions for different phenomena or observations, analysis techniques to tease out interesting signals from data, and planning for future observational campaigns. See below for a selection of specific topics I have worked on.</p>

			</br>

			<h2>Gravitational Lensing</h2>

			<p>When we look through a magnifying glass or fisheye lens, we see an image that has been warped or distorted in a certain way. When we look out into the universe, the images that we see are distorted in a similar way; in this case, the laws of gravity cause massive structures to act as lenses, distorting the paths of light rays that pass by them. By examining an image, we can learn about the properties and distributions of these lenses, and therefore learn about the distribution of matter along the line of sight.</p>

				Lensing of line intensity maps</h3>

			<p>Techniques developed for measuring lensing of cosmic microwave background maps can be adapted for line intensity maps (such as of 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen), but one must be careful to account for the nonlinear, non-Gaussian nature of these maps.

				Baryonic effects on cosmic shear</h3>
			<p>The lensing distortions of observed galaxy shapes are affected by baryonic effects (gas cooling, feedback), and this is often seen as a nuisance that obscures useful cosmological information. However, one can also use lensing to constrain models for these effects, and obtain interesting constraints even from near-term galaxy surveys.

				<h2>Cosmological Perturbation Theory</h2>

				<p>At very large distances, we have robust theoretical descriptions for the clustering patterns of density fluctuations in the universe, as traced by luminous objects such as galaxies. As we examine smaller and smaller distances, this description begins to break down due to the increasing strength of clustering. Cosmological simulations are a helpful tool for investigating this regime, but there is also a range of distances at which the deviations from the long-distance description are small enough that they can be treated as perturbations, and systematically accounted for using perturbation theory. This is most usefully phrased using the language of effective field theory, borrowed from particle physics, and this language has allowed for a number of advances in the robustness of these predictions.</p>

					Computation of 2- and 3-point statistics</h3>
				<p>Effective field theory techniques can be used to compute clustering statistics (the so-called matter power spectrum and bispectrum) in a self-consistent and systematic way.

				<h2>Other Topics</h2>

				<p>Here is a sample of some other things I have worked on.</p>

</br>

				<h3><img class="res_img_right" src="research_images/paper_figure_strings.png" width="26%" height="26%">
					Cosmic strings in the CMB</h3>
				<p>Anticipated constraints on the average tension of cosmic strings will be weakened if other properties of the strings, such as their mean velocity and "wiggliness" are left free in the modeling. Predictions that explore this full parameter space can be rather computationally expensive, but an efficient code that interpolates between the results of full evaluations can greatly speed up the parameter estimation process.

				</p>

			</br>

				<h3><img class="res_img_left" src="research_images/paper_figure_void.png" width="27%" height="27%">
					Inhomogeneous cosmology</h3>
				<p>It has been proposed that dark energy can be replaced by a large, underdense void as an explanation for the recent acceleration of the cosmic expansion. Such an explanation would lead to a large CMB dipole, unless we are located very close to the void center. Comparison with the observed CMB dipole yields a tuning problem for void models of this type.
