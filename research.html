			<h2>Overview</h2>
		<!-- </br> -->
				<p>I am broadly interested in developing and refining methods we can use to learn about the universe. This encompasses theoretical predictions for different phenomena or observations, analysis techniques to tease out interesting signals from data, and planning for future observational campaigns. See below for a selection of specific topics I have worked on.</p>

			</br>

			<h2>Line Intensity Mapping</h2>

		<p>We can make large maps of the large-scale structure of the universe by measuring fluctuations in the intensity of radiation from different atomic or molecular transitions occurring in galaxies or the intergalactic medium. This method is highly complementary to traditional galaxy surveys, involving different technology and in principle allowing access to much larger distances away from us. I am working at the forefront of this exciting new area.</p>

			The CHIME telescope</h3>

		<p>The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment is currently collecting data from its site near Penticton, BC, Canada, with the goal of measuring the imprints of primordial sound waves in the cosmic distribution of neutral hydrogen. I am part of the team working on methods development and data analysis to make this measurement a reality.

			Lensing of line intensity maps</h3>

		<p>Techniques developed for measuring lensing of cosmic microwave background maps can be adapted for line intensity maps (such as of 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen), but one must be careful to account for the nonlinear, non-Gaussian nature of these maps.

		<h2>Cosmological Perturbation Theory</h2>

		<p>At very large distances, we have robust theoretical descriptions for the clustering patterns of density fluctuations in the universe, as traced by luminous objects such as galaxies. As we examine smaller and smaller distances, this description begins to break down due to the increasing strength of clustering. Cosmological simulations are a helpful tool for investigating this regime, but there is also a range of distances at which the deviations from the long-distance description are small enough that they can be treated as perturbations, and systematically accounted for using perturbation theory. This is most usefully phrased using the language of effective field theory, borrowed from particle physics, and this language has allowed for a number of advances in the robustness of these predictions.</p>

			Computation of 2- and 3-point statistics</h3>
		<p>Effective field theory techniques can be used to compute clustering statistics (the so-called matter power spectrum and bispectrum) in a self-consistent and systematic way.

			<h2>Baryonic Effects in Large-Scale Structure</h2>

			<p>The clustering of galaxies, and matter in general, is not only determined by gravitational forces at large distances, but is influenced by astrophysical processes such as gas cooling, star formation, and energy injection by supernovae and the surroundings of supermassive black holes. These so-called "baryonic" effects need to be understood to make the most use of clustering measurements that will be made in the near future.</p>

			<h3><img class="res_img_right" src="research_images/paper_figure_baryon_bs.png" width="27%" height="27%">
				Baryonic effects on matter 3-point statistics</h3>
			<p>These effects on 3-point statistics have not been investigated as extensively as for 2-point statistics, but 3-point correlation function measurements could provide a new pathway to constraining simulation-based models for these effects, or testing the consistency of different modelling approaches.

			<h3><img class="res_img_left" src="research_images/paper_figure_shear_baryons.png" width="27%" height="27%">
				Baryonic effects on cosmic shear</h3>
			<p>The lensing distortions of observed galaxy shapes are affected by these effects, and this is often seen as a nuisance that obscures useful cosmological information. However, one can also use lensing to constrain models for these effects, and obtain interesting constraints even from near-term galaxy surveys.

			<h2>Cosmic Microwave Background</h2>

				<p>The CMB has been the workhorse of modern cosmology, providing unparalleled information about the overall properties of the universe. However, this wellspring of information has not been exhausted: there is still work left to do on a variety of uses for the CMB.</p>

</br>

				<h3><img class="res_img_right" src="research_images/paper_figure_strings.png" width="26%" height="26%">
					Cosmic strings in the CMB</h3>
				<p>Anticipated constraints on the average tension of cosmic strings will be weakened if other properties of the strings, such as their mean velocity and "wiggliness" are left free in the modeling. Predictions that explore this full parameter space can be rather computationally expensive, but an efficient code that interpolates between the results of full evaluations can greatly speed up the parameter estimation process.

				<h3><img class="res_img_left" src="research_images/paper_figure_void.png" width="27%" height="27%">
					Inhomogeneous cosmology</h3>
				<p>It has been proposed that dark energy can be replaced by a large, underdense void as an explanation for the recent acceleration of the cosmic expansion. Such an explanation would lead to a large CMB dipole, unless we are located very close to the void center. Comparison with the observed CMB dipole yields a tuning problem for void models of this type.
